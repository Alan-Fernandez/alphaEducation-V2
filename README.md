## Installation

To install the project dependencies, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

## Setting up the .env.local file

The `.env.local` file is used to store environment variables in your Next.js project. Follow these steps to create it:

1. At the root of your project, create a file named `.env.local`.

2. Open the `.env.local` file and define your environment variables following the format `VARIABLE_NAME=value`. For example:

    ```plaintext
    API_KEY=my_secret_key
    API_URL=https://api.example.com
    ```

3. Save and close the `.env.local` file.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the `.env.local` file, you can run the project locally:
